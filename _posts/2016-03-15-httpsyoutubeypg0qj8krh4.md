Dear God, I thank you this morning for the Rock of my salvation. I thank you that my life can be built upon a strong foundation. 
Please help me to trust, to live, to take every breath based upon the foundation I have in you. 
Please help me to weather life's storms, to keep looking to you, and to be a thankful child...never a pouting brat.
I pray that you will strengthen me and keep my feet steady on solid ground. 
I pray for my family members, Lord, that each one will be committed to you and live a life that glorifies you and ministers to others. 
In the blessed name of Jesus I pray, amen.
